# SliDesk Syntax

SliDesk features a simplified syntax inspired by other lightweight markup languages. This syntax is transformed into html by the engine. This makes it possible to change the style using CSS.

For example :

"# " defines a level 1 title
"## " defines a level 2 title and a new slide

Paragraphs are separated with an empty line.
