SliDesk can read a `.env` file.

If your talk's directory have a `.env`, then you can use it for many purpose.

With this option, you can specify the path of your `.env` file to load.

```
slidesk -c .tnt.env my-talk
```

## SliDesk configuration

See the proper chapter: [Configuration of SliDesk](/docs/configuration/intro)

## Plugin usage

SliDesk will create an object property in `window.slidesk.env` to give you an access of key-value.

Example:

```dotenv
MYVAR="test"
```

If your plugin execute this following script, it will display in console "test".

```js
console.log(window.slidesk.env.MYVAR);
```

## Template usage

SliDesk allows you to fetch value from a `.env` file. With this following syntax:

```
++MYVAR++
```

This entry will be replaced with its content `test` when it renders the presentation.
