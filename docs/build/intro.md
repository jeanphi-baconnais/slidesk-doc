# How to build SliDesk?

If you can't install through the different solutions proposed, you can build SliDesk by yourself.

Once you clone the repository, you can install the dependencies with:

```sh
bun install
```

And create the "exe" file with:

```sh
bun make:exe
```

Then you'll have a `exe/slidesk` file created.
